      <h1>Controllers and Routing</h1>
      <h2>Quick introduction to controllers and actions</h2>
      <p>
        Many of you already understand the concept of controllers and how they work. As you have seen in the any of the previous
        examples controllers are associated with either a direct path in your application or a specific set of functions
        
        When a user is browsing your site his or her request is always being handled by one or more controllers, the controllers
        are the layer between the <span class="label">Request</span> and the <span class="label">Response</span> that handles your logics.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Actions
      </h3>
      <p>
        When Smll MVC is routing your request to a controller it calls an action on the controller, by default Smll MVC will call the <span class="label">index</span> action.
        lets say that you which to have a path on your site like this "about/me", by default Smll MVC will try to call the me action on the AboutController.
      </p>
      <h2>Routing, who get's to do what?</h2>
      <p>
        As you have probably already figured out Smll MVC is interally by some magic figuring out which controller 
        is responsible for handelling a particular path.
        
        This magic is called routing and it's quite a powerfull feature. It allowes Smll MVC to figure out by a set of rules
        which Controller is repsonsible for different paths in your application.
        
        By providing a router map, you can control how Smll will route your request internally.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>The default MVC route.</strong>
      </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-php linenums">
$this->routerConfig->mapRoute(
        new Route("Default", "{controller}/{action}/{id}", 
            array(
                "controller" => "Home", 
                "action" => "index", 
                "id" => Route::URLPARAMETER_OPTIONAL)));
</pre>

      
      <h2>Custom routes</h2>
			<p>
			 As you might have guessed, the default route is whats makes Smll MVC route your requests to your controllers
			 say that you create a Controller called <span class="label">AboutController</span> then you will by the default route be able to access
			 this router through http://www.example.com/About
			</p>
      <p>
        But say that you don't want to create a second controller for this particular page, "About", you instead wish to 
        use your HomeController and handle the request with a <span class="label">Action</span>!
        
        You simply add a new Route that looks like this.
         
      </p>
      
<pre class="prettyprint lang-php linenums">
$this->routerConfig->mapRoute(
        new Route("About", "About",
            array(
                "controller" => "Home",
                "action" => "about",
                "id" => Route::URLPARAMETER_OPTIONAL)));
</pre>
      <p>
        don't freight, we will explain in the next chapter how these routes work and how you configure them into your application.
        for now just keep in mind that Smll MVC uses this pattern for defining routes to controllers and actions.
