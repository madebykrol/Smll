Smll CMS
==== 
Smll CMS is currently in a very early stage of development, and is not ready for production development right now.

If you have feature requests and issues with the current version, please read the up coming roadmap, and look for changes to the source on git.
Once the CMS is in a Release candidate state, development of the master branch will stop, and you will be able to do production work
with Smll MVC and the framework.



Smll framework and the CMS is currently bundled with Bootstrap 2.3.2 
And jQuery 1.9.1
