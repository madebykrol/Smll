Smll
==== 
This framework has been undergoing some extensive rewriting from the ground up
to incorporate a better MVC structure, better inversion of control and some other new cool features.

It's inspired by .NET MVC another framework that I'm very found of using

Smll framework is currently bundled with Bootstrap 2.3.2 
And jQuery 1.9.1 for quick prototyping.

for examples and docs see: http://madebykrol.github.io/Smll/

Getting Started
====
Smll is follows a fairly straightforward and common MVC pattern.
It has
- Custom Routing
- Model binding
- Partial views
- Built in Role and Membership providers
- Actionfilters 

And alot more features which will aid your development

Quick guide
===
Download the zip/tarball unpack in your project folder.
Then install the database schemas defined in the smll/install/smll.sql file.
After that you are clear to go. remove any controllers models and views which you will not need, and then set up your own business logic.

The framework will handle the routing to your controllers for most of your usecases, for custom routing
consult the manual.
