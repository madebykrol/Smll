Smll
==== 
This framework has been undergoing some extensive rewriting from the ground up
to incorporate a better MVC structure, better inversion of control and some other new cool features.

It's inspired by .NET MVC another framework that I'm very found of using

Smll framework is currently bundled with Bootstrap 2.3.2 
And jQuery 1.9.1
